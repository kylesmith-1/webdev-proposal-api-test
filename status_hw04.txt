4. How much of the functionality did you complete?

All of it, I believe.

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?

Yes, as in it works on hw04.devcalibur.com.
However, the styling does not seem to work right. 
I was having issues with `npm install` in the assets
directory.

Fairly, I found it to have a high learning curve. Though I
definitely feel much better equiped to use it and the
documentation now vs when I started this assignment.

Could not get styling to work on deploy. Also I found Elixir
to be a pain to work with. At least I found the learning curve to 
be high.
